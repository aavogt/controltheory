# Controltheory

## Implemented
* root locus
    * automatically selects proportional gains that include break points and
      gains that make the system marginally stable
* inverse laplace transform, including
    * settling times
    * time to peak
* utilities for dealing with ratios of polynomials (rational)

## TODO
* frequency response (Bod√©,  Nyquist)
* pretty printing of Routh array
* bilinear transform for root locus (coord_transform?)
* rational currently expands polynomials, which need to be factored in some cases later on.
